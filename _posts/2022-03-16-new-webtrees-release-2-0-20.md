webtrees 2.0.20 is now available for download.

It includes updated census definitions and a fix to markdown formatting.

All development is now taking place on the 2.1 branch of the code.
The 2.0 branch is now in maintenance mode, and will only receive updates
for security issues and major bugs.

Support will end when PHP 7.4 reaches end-of-life in November 2021.

See the [change log](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees/compare/2.0.19...2.0.20) for details.
